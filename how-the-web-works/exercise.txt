PART ONE
1. HTTP is a protocol, which is a set of rules for how information is sent between clients and servers.
2. URL is short for Uniform Resource Loctator. A url is an address for some internet resource
3. DNS is short for Domain Name System. DNS is a system that translates hostnames into an ip address for a server.
4. A query string is how you can pass key-value pairs into the url. It is at the end of a URL located after resources
5. GET- gets data from the server without changing any data on the server.
    POST- sends data to the server and changes data on the server.
6. An HTTP request is a request from client to server following the HTTP protocol. 
7. An HTTP response is a rsponse from a server to a client foloowing the HTTP protocol.
8. An HTTP header are some of the attributes that the client asks the server for. For example, a browser knows what language the user typically wants so 
    in the header the browser is requesting the content to be in the users preferred language.
9. First the browswer tries to find the ip address of the server hosting hostname. It starts locally at the computer and if it doesn't find the ip address 
    it ultimately moves to the DNS to find the ip address. From there an HTTP request is sent to the server via the specified URL. The Server then sends a 
    response depending on if the request matches what is on the server. The browser then loads the DOM sent from the server. The browswer then makes several more 
    request depending what is in the HTML of the DOM.
